# Discussions

This folder contains pre-publication discussions and drafts for blog posts. Each discussion lives in its own folder and serves as the foundation for a blog post.

## Structure

```
discussions/
├── topic-name-1/
│   ├── notes.md
│   ├── research.md
│   └── draft.md
├── topic-name-2/
│   └── ...
└── README.md (this file)
```

## Workflow

1. **Create a discussion folder** - Use a descriptive name (e.g., `distributed-tracing`, `async-patterns`)
2. **Develop ideas** - Add notes, research, code examples, and drafts
3. **Refine content** - Iterate on the discussion materials
4. **Publish** - When ready, create a properly formatted post in `_posts/`

## Discussion Folder Organization

Each discussion folder can contain:
- `notes.md` - Raw notes and ideas
- `research.md` - Links, references, and research materials
- `draft.md` - Working draft of the blog post
- `examples/` - Code examples or diagrams
- Any other relevant materials

## Tips

- Use discussions to develop ideas before committing to a full blog post
- Keep related materials together in the discussion folder
- No strict format required - organize as needed for your thinking process
- When publishing, the final post goes to `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

## Difference from `drafts/`

- **`discussions/`** - Early-stage idea development, research, and exploration
- **`drafts/`** - Nearly-complete posts in Jekyll format, ready for final review before publishing
